# Weather App

## Description

This weather app will allow the user to search for any city and return the current conditions as well as a 5-day forecast. Each search is saved to a button at the bottom of the page so it can be quickly revsited. There is a clear button as well to allow users to clear the page.

This app requires the use of two weather APIs, one for the current conditions and one for the forecast which required iteration to select the correct elements for the page.
